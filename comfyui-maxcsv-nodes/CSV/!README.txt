EZ CSV Reader Node only reads .csv files with ";" (semicolon) as a delimiter

While not commonly used formatting for .csv, this makes populating files with prompts a bit easier
as you don't have to worry about quotation marks

Also native for Microsoft Excel reading and saving

Note: Refreshing widgets will always override selected prompt (selected file will not be changed)
